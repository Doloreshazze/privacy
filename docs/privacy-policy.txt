Privacy Policy for "VPN for Friends"Last Updated: July 20, 2024Welcome to "VPN for Friends" 
(hereinafter "Application," "Service," "we," "us," "our")! We, Playeverywhere, value your privacy 
and are committed to protecting your data. This Privacy Policy explains what minimal information 
we process for the operation of our VPN service, how we protect it, and your rights regarding this 
information.1. What Data We Process and WhyWe adhere to the principle of minimal data collection 
and process only the information that is absolutely necessary for the provision and functioning of 
the "VPN for Friends" VPN service.•Information necessary to establish a VPN connection:•Your VPN 
client's public key: We receive your WireGuard public key, which is generated within the 
Application, to authenticate your device on our server and provide you with the VPN configuration. 
This key does not personally identify you without the corresponding private key, which is stored 
only on your device.•Client IP address assigned by the server: Our server assigns your VPN client 
a temporary internal IP address within the VPN network for the duration of the session.•Temporary 
connection information: To establish and maintain a VPN connection, and to route your internet 
traffic through our servers, your original IP address and destination IP addresses are temporarily 
processed by our servers solely during an active VPN session. This information is not logged, not 
stored, and is discarded immediately after your VPN session ends or the connection is 
terminated.We do not collect and do not request:•Your name, email address, or other personal 
contact information to use the Application.•Data about your location.•Information about your 
device beyond what is minimally necessary to establish a VPN connection (e.g., OS type for 
protocol compatibility).2. How We Use Processed InformationInformation processed during your VPN 
session is used exclusively for the following purposes:•Providing the VPN Service: To establish, 
maintain, and correctly function a secure VPN connection, and to route your internet traffic 
through our servers.•Authentication: To verify your right to use the Service using the provided 
public key.•Ensuring Service Stability: For basic server health monitoring (e.g., load) in an 
aggregated and anonymous manner, without linking to specific users or their activity.3. No-Logs 
PolicyWe adhere to a strict no-logs policy. This means we do not collect, store, or log:•Your real 
(original) IP address.•DNS queries you make while using the VPN.•Any information about the 
websites you visit or applications you use.•The content of your internet traffic.•Connection 
timestamps or session duration associated with your identifier.All information necessary for 
traffic routing exists only in the server's temporary memory and is deleted when the VPN session 
ends.4. Third-Party Services and Data TransferThe "VPN for Friends" Application does not use 
third-party services for analytics, advertising, tracking, or any other purposes that could lead 
to the collection or transfer of your data to third parties. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise 
transfer any information about you or your use of the Service to third parties, except where it 
may be strictly necessary to comply with applicable law upon a lawful and valid request from 
authorized government authorities (e.g., by court order). We will make every effort to protect 
your privacy even in such situations, acting within the law.5. Data SecurityWe use the WireGuard 
protocol, which is a modern and secure VPN protocol that ensures the encryption of your traffic. 
We take reasonable technical measures to protect the infrastructure of our Service. However, it is 
important to understand that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic 
storage is 100% secure.6. Data RetentionAs stated above, we do not store logs of your activity or 
personal data. Information necessary to establish a VPN connection is processed solely in 
real-time and is not retained after the session ends.7. Your Rights (for users in the EU/EEA and 
other regions with similar legislation)Given that we do not collect or store your personal data, 
the exercise of some rights may be limited by the absence of such data. However, you always have 
the right to:•Request information about what categories of data are processed for the functioning 
of the service.•Withdraw consent to use the service by simply discontinuing its use.If you have 
concerns about data processing despite our minimization policy, please contact us.To exercise 
these rights or if you have questions, please contact us at: playeverywhere999@gmail.com.8.
