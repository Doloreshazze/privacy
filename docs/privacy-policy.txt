Privacy Policy for Applications by Playeverywhere

Last Updated: October 16, 2025

Welcome to the applications and services developed by Playeverywhere (hereinafter "we," "us," "our," or "the Developer").
We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your data. This Privacy Policy explains what minimal information we may process across our applications, how we protect it, and your rights regarding this information.

1. Scope of This Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile applications and services published under the Playeverywhere developer account (collectively, ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù or ‚ÄúServices‚Äù), including but not limited to VPN, utility, productivity, and entertainment apps.

Each Application may have its own specific features, but the general principles of privacy protection described below apply to all of them.

2. What Data We Process and Why

We adhere to the principle of minimal data collection and process only the information that is absolutely necessary for the operation of each Application. Depending on the type of Application, this may include:

Technical information necessary for functionality (e.g., device OS type, app version, basic diagnostics).

Connection information (for network-based apps like VPNs): temporary IP routing data, session keys, or public keys used solely to establish secure connections.

Anonymous performance data (if enabled): aggregate crash logs or basic analytics provided by the app store or system (without personal identifiers).

We do not collect or request:

Your name, email address, phone number, or other personal contact data (unless explicitly provided for support).

Your location data.

Any content of your communications or personal files.

All information processed by our Applications is used exclusively to ensure their correct and secure operation.

3. How We Use Processed Information

The limited data processed by our Applications is used solely for:

Providing and maintaining core functionality of the Application.

Ensuring security and stability of the service.

Responding to user support requests, when you voluntarily contact us.

We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or tracking purposes.

4. No-Logs and No-Tracking Policy

Playeverywhere Applications follow a strict no-logs policy:

We do not record or store your IP address, connection timestamps, or identifiers.

We do not monitor your online activity or collect information about websites you visit or apps you use.

Any temporary data (e.g., session data for network connections) exists only in memory and is deleted immediately after the session ends.

5. Third-Party Services and Data Transfer

Our Applications do not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs unless explicitly stated in the respective app description.
We do not sell, rent, or share any information with third parties, except where required by applicable law in response to a lawful and valid request from authorized authorities (e.g., by court order).
Even in such cases, we will make every effort to protect your privacy within the limits of the law.

6. Data Security

We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard the data processed by our Applications.
For network-based apps (such as VPN), we use secure and modern protocols (e.g., WireGuard) to encrypt traffic.
However, please understand that no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure.

7. Data Retention

We do not store logs or personal data.
Any temporary information used for session establishment or internal functionality is automatically deleted once the process or session ends.

8. Your Rights (for Users in the EU/EEA and Similar Jurisdictions)

Because we do not collect identifiable personal data, the scope of your rights is naturally limited.
Nevertheless, you always have the right to:

Request general information about the categories of data processed.

Withdraw consent by discontinuing the use of the Application.

Contact us with any privacy-related questions or concerns.

To exercise these rights or ask questions, please contact us at:

9. Children‚Äôs Privacy

Our Applications are not intended for use by individuals under 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction).
We do not knowingly collect information from minors. If you believe a minor has provided us with data, please contact us, and we will promptly delete it.

10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
When we make material changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date and, where appropriate, provide notice within our Applications.
You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically for updates.
